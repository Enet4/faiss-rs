This project provides Rust bindings to [Faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss),
the state-of-the-art vector search and clustering library.

## Installing with dynamic linking

By default, this crate is dynamically linked with the Faiss library installed in your system,
so it does not build Faiss automatically for you.
To build the library yourself:

  1. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Enet4/faiss/tree/c_api_head/INSTALL.md#step-1-invoking-cmake)
     to build Faiss using CMake,
     enabling the variables `FAISS_ENABLE_C_API` and `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`.
     The crate is currently only compatible with version v1.7.2.
     Consider building Faiss from [this fork, `c_api_head` branch](https://github.com/Enet4/faiss/tree/c_api_head),
     which will contain the latest supported bindings to the C interface.
     For example:

     ```sh
     cmake -B build -DFAISS_ENABLE_C_API=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
     cmake --build build
     ```

     This will result in the dynamic library `faiss_c` ("c_api/libfaiss_c.so" on Linux),
     which needs to be installed in a place where your system will pick up
     (in Linux, try somewhere in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, such as "/usr/lib",
     or try adding a new path to this variable. For mac users, this means placing it in `/usr/local/lib/libfaiss_c.dylib`).
     For GPU support, don't forget to enable the option `FAISS_ENABLE_GPU`.
     **Note:** `faiss_c` might link dynamically to the native `faiss` library,
     which in that case you will need to install the main shared object (faiss/libfaiss.so)
     as well.
  2. You are now ready to include this crate as a dependency:

     ```toml
     [dependencies]
     "faiss" = "0.11.0"
     ```

If you have built Faiss with GPU support, you can include the "gpu" Cargo feature:

```toml
[dependencies]
"faiss" = { version = "0.11.0", features = ["gpu"] }
```

## Installing with static linking

Alternatively to the above, enable the "static" Cargo feature to let Rust build Faiss for you.
You will still need the dependencies required to build and run Faiss
as described in their [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/Enet4/faiss/blob/c_api_head/INSTALL.md#building-from-source),
namely a compatible C++ compiler and a BLAS implementation.

```toml
[dependencies]
"faiss" = { version = "0.11.0", features = ["static"] }
```

Compiling Faiss with GPU support is also possible.

```toml
[dependencies]
"faiss" = { version = "0.11.0", features = ["static", "gpu"] }
```

## Troubleshooting on Windows

Getting this library to work properly on Windows is non-trivial because FAISS
requires a BLAS, and Windows doesn't have a default one. There are a few
options for your BLAS.

### Intel oneAPI

Intel's MKL can function as a BLAS, and the typical way it is installed on
Windows is through Intel's
[oneAPI](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl-download.html).
Set the `ONEAPI_ROOT` environment variable while building to the folder where
oneAPI is installed (typically `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI`) and the
build script of `faiss-rs` should pick it up automatically.

## Using

A basic example is seen below. Please check out the [documentation](https://docs.rs/faiss) for more.

```rust
use faiss::{Index, index_factory, MetricType};

let mut index = index_factory(64, "Flat", MetricType::L2)?;
index.add(&my_data)?;

let result = index.search(&my_query, 5)?;
for (i, (l, d)) in result.labels.iter()
    .zip(result.distances.iter())
    .enumerate()
{
    println!("#{}: {} (D={})", i + 1, *l, *d);
}
```
